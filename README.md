# Tech Task: SwiftUI Implementation with TCA

## Background
At BrightHR, for legacy features, we are using UIKit and for new features, we are using SwiftUI. We are in the process of migrating UIKit to SwiftUI. For SwiftUI, we are using a mixture of MVVM and the Composable Architecture (TCA).

For more info on TCA click [here](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture).

## Task Description
We've provided a skeleton project with a root view implemented using SwiftUI and TCA. Your task is to complete the implementation by addressing all TODOs in the codebase, which include:

1. Navigation Implementation:

    - Create a navigation flow between Screens A, B, and C using SwiftUI's NavigationStack
    - Implement "pop to root" functionality

2. UI Presentations:

    - Implement various presentation patterns:
    - Confirmation dialogs
    - Alerts
    - Bottom sheets
    - Full-screen covers

3. TCA Implementation:

    - Structure the application state properly
    - Implement reducers for handling navigation logic
    - Manage state transitions between screens

## Requirements
- Navigation should be done using SwiftUI NavigationStack (not NavigationView)
- Code should follow TCA patterns and best practices
- Implementation should be complete for all TODOs in the codebase
- Unit tests should be included for your implementation
- Use the latest available version of TCA at the time of completing this task

## Build Tools

| Tool           |                       Version |
| :------------- | ----------------------------: |
| iOS Target     |                          18.0 |
| Swift          |                          6.0  |

## Evaluation Criteria
You will be assessed on:

- SwiftUI knowledge
- TCA implementation skills
- Code structure and organization
- Readability and effectiveness of unit tests

## Estimated Time
This task should take less than 3 hours to complete.

## Submission

Please complete your implementation using the following steps:

1. Fork the repository
3. Implement all the required features with meaningful commits that demonstrate your approach
4. Once complete, push your implementation to your GitHub repository
5. Submit the GitHub repository URL to the provided submission link/email
